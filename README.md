# Elm Advent of Code 2019

This project is scaffolded with [elm-aoc-starter](https://github.com/fpapado/aoc-2019-elm)

## Running

You will need [Node][node] and [npm][npm]. npm comes installed with Node.
It should not matter much which versions, though either way I'd recommend you use [nvm][nvm] to install Node. It works better without needing admin privileges for every npm installation.

You will also need [git][git].

Then, in a terminal, like iterm or gnome terminal, run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fpapado/aoc-2019-elm.git
cd aoc-2019-elm
npm ci
npm test

# npm run solve day part
npm run solve 1 1
```
